Course Objectives: Students will learn the basic principles that govern the workings of the
physical world around them. Students will learn to collect, sort, and analyze numerical data to
quantify relationships. Students will apply mathematical relationships to describe physical
phenomena, including concepts and applications using differential and integral calculus. Students
will learn the scientific method. Students will learn to work both cooperatively in groups and
independently throughout the course to help develop better critical thinking skills. The course
utilizes guided inquiry and student-centered learning to foster the development of critical thinking
skills.
Prerequisites: A solid understanding of geometry and algebra including systems of equations,
exponents, scientific notation, ratio and proportion, quadratics, graphs, slope, and a solid
understanding of trigonometry. Concurrent enrollment in AP Calculus or prior passing AP
Calculus required. You should have all A’s and B’s in all prior math classes as success in
AP physics relies heavily on your mathematical abilities.
Specific topics include:
a) Systems of measurement and unit conversions
b) Measurement and error
c) Vectors and vector mathematics
d) Position, velocity, and acceleration
e) Uniformly accelerating objects in one and two dimensions
f) Freefall
g) Projectile motion
h) Forces
i) Newton’s laws of motion
j) Uniform circular motion
k) Energy, work and power
l) The law of conservation of energy and applications
m) Momentum and the law of conservation of momentum for systems of particles
n) Universal law of gravitation
o) Oscillations and simple harmonic motion
p) Rotational motion including rotational kinematics and dynamics
For a specific list of topics and weighting, see the AP Physics C curriculum at
The college board website.
Labs: The course includes a laboratory component comparable to a semester-long, college-level
physics laboratory. Students spend a minimum of 20 percent of instructional time engaged in
laboratory work. A hands-on laboratory component is required. Each student should complete a
lab notebook or portfolio of lab reports. Students will be required to collect, sort, and analyze
data through various methods. Each student will be responsible for individual lab write ups and
should keep their lab reports for future college credit verification. Labs will employ a variety of
methods including verification of expected results and discovery labs. Students will work
together and separately depending on the individual lab. Students are always expected to do
independent analysis and certify that all written lab work represents the individual student’s
independent work.

Homework: Homework will be assigned almost every night. Length of assignments will vary
but will average 50 minutes per night.
Grading: Graded material will consist of tests, quizzes, labs, projects, homework, and a final
exam. Approximate % of points earned for each part of the class will be
Tests: 30-50% Quizzes: 5-15%, Labs: 30-40% Homework: 5-15% Final exam:15-25%
Grading is based on points. Each assignment will earn a certain number of points. Final grades
will be based on the percentage of total points earned. Grades will be on a traditional
90/80/70/60/50% A/B/C/D/F grading scale.
Materials needed by students: A scientific calculator, mechanical pencils, 1.5”+ 3 ring binder,
1⁄4” graph paper, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to work hard.

Electronic Use Policy: Unless specifically instructed by the teacher to use electronic
devices during class, no electronic devices are to be used during class time. Phones
being used during class time when not allowed will be confiscated and given to an
administrator in the office for pickup at the end of the day.
Classroom/lab Donations: Great lab science is expensive. To support the lab work we
do throughout the year, we ask for a $30 or more donation per student so that we can
purchase and replace lab equipment and consumables throughout the year. Almost all
of our lab equipment has come from parent donations. Whatever you can give is truly
appreciated as it allows us to continue to do great lab work. Donations can be made by
check or via an online portal that will become available shortly. Thank you for your
continued support.

Expectations on Classroom Environment: Show up! Be on time. Be courteous and
kind to others in the class. Be curious. Be participatory. Be ready to be challenged,
learn, work hard, and have fun!
Attendance: Consistent attendance is critical for success in the class. Class credit
will be withheld from students with excessive unexcused absences
(defined as 10% of scheduled days). Withheld credit will be reported as an
“F” grade for the semester. Students with five or more unexcused
absences per semester will receive an “Unsatisfactory” mark for their
citizenship.
