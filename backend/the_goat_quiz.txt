                         ANSWER KEY
======================================================================

Question 1: A
  Answer: 24 square units
  Explanation: The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height. Here, A = (1/2)(8)(6) = 24 square units.

Question 2: A
  Answer: d = 2r
  Explanation: The diameter of a circle is always twice the length of its radius. This fundamental relationship is expressed as d = 2r, where d is diameter and r is radius.

Question 3: C
  Answer: 540°
  Explanation: For any polygon with n sides, the sum of interior angles is (n-2) × 180°. For a pentagon (n=5), this is (5-2) × 180° = 3 × 180° = 540°.

Question 4: B
  Answer: 3x^2
  Explanation: Using the power rule, when differentiating x^n, multiply by the exponent and reduce the power by 1. For x^3, multiply by 3 and reduce power to 2, giving 3x^2.

Question 5: C
  Answer: sin(x)
  Explanation: The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), therefore sin(x) is an antiderivative of cos(x). This can be verified by differentiating sin(x).

Question 6: C
  Answer: e
  Explanation: This is the fundamental limit that defines the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828). As n gets larger, this expression converges to e.

Question 7: C
  Answer: Graphing
  Explanation: When both equations are in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), graphing is most efficient as you can quickly plot both lines and find their intersection point without any algebraic manipulation.

Question 8: A
  Answer: Lines are parallel
  Explanation: Parallel lines never intersect, which geometrically represents a system with no solution (inconsistent system). The lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts.

Question 9: B
  Answer: They are the same line
  Explanation: When two linear equations represent the same line (identical equations), every point on that line satisfies both equations, resulting in infinitely many solutions (dependent system).
